5. update repo:

## how to custom the theme:

modify `_config.yml` in root path and `_config.yml` in `.themes/next`Ôºåaccording to the hexo official manual and `hexo-next-theme` official guidance. üëáüëáüëá

- hexo official doc: https://hexo.io/zh-cn/docs/index.html

- next -theme official doc: https://theme-next.js.org/docs/getting-started/
- old-version-next-theme doc: http://theme-next.iissnan.com/

‚ùó **NOTE:**

The `next-them` itself is a git repo. However, it is so troublesome to maintain homepage main project and theme sub project at the same time. Therefore, the `.git` in `.themes/next` is deleted so that the `next-them`  becomes a normal directory which can be commit together.

If there is a need to maintain two projects separately, we can refer to:
